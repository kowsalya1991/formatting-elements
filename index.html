<h1 style="color:red;"><u>Bannerghatta Biological Park</u></h1>
<p>
<img style="float:right; height:420px;width:650px" src="images\Bear-in-Bannerghatta-National-Park.jpg" alt=" Bears in Bannerghatta zoo"><strong>Bannerughatta Biological Park Bengaluru</strong> is a unique region of ecological importance as it's situated on the northern terminal point of Mysuru Elephant Reserve. <em><b>The Park plays a major role in conservation of rich floral, faunal diversity , sequester carbon and sustains regional hydrology.</b></em></p>

As you are aware that our pristine wildlife and it's habitat are under severe pressure, the main objective of the zoo is ex- situ conservation and augment the depleting population of the endangered species. At present over 2300 animals belonging to 102 species are being protected in naturalistic environment and provided with veterinary care at the Park.</p>

The Park <del>example of delete</del> is committed to realize the <s> example of strikeout</s> objective of<mark> National Zoo Policy,1998 </mark>by supporting the National efforts in conservation of rich biodiversity and <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG-15)</strong> Life on Land!</p>

I am sure that you are aware that the Park is not a place for amusement or entertainment. I am pleased to share that as a part of our Education and outreach activity under chinnara mrugalaya darshana program, over 1500 students from Government schools were inspired by providing a guided tour at zoo on conservation of natural resources for maintaining ecological balance.</p>

At the outset I would like to mention that one of the main objective of the Park is to inspire citizens and create education to showcase the linkage between the survival of species and protection of natural habitat. As a result more enquiries were received by visitors on adoption of animals.</p>

My humble appeal to all the visitors is to make use of the display boards and signages to understand the nature and the important role we the Humans (Homo sapiens) can play in conservation and survival of species!</p>

<mark style="background-color:olive";>I wish everyone to have an enriching, educative experience in the Park and spread the message of Conservation !!</mark></p>
